How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Software Test Automation and Quality Assurance is an exceptional source to learn JUnit testing
procedures for application development. Understanding specific testing processes
and quality assurance is mandatory for professional application development. Building test
methods during development formalizes code to prevent software malfunction and detects errors.


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
SDLC is the mainframe with supportive timelines that verify project alignment during development.
During the planning phase, it is recommended to create a business model for user needs and requirements
before defining the project scope or designing the software. These necessary documents are important to maintain 
reliability measures for the project.

How do I approach designing software?
Comprehensive, valuable software is engineered by Planning, Design, Development, Testing and Production.
Strategic software design has purpose and functionality as the main objective. Begin by requesting user needs
and functional requirements, then decide aesthetics and security features that will be necessary for the project.
After planning, it is best to implement testing procedures in the design scope to prevent issues and track performance.
